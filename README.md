# LLM-based AI Agent for Sizing of Analog and Mixed Signal Circuit

## Introduction

This project introduces an LLM-based AI agent designed to assist with sizing in analog and mixed-signal (AMS) circuit design. By integrating large language models (LLMs) with Ngspice simulation, custom data analysis functions, and employing prompt engineering strategies, the agent effectively optimizes circuits to meet specified performance metrics.
The tool takes as input a SPICE-based netlist and natural language performance specifications, and outputs both an iterative optimization process and the final optimized netlist. You can visualize and track the optimization history and verify the robustness of the final design using the provided variation test. Multiple LLMs are supported and can be selected by the user.

## Key Features

1. AI-assisted sizing: Get LLM-generated suggestions for transistor dimensions based on input specifications
2. SPICE-compatible output: Generates netlists compatible with popular circuit simulators ngspice.
3. Simulation in-loop: Achieved by LLM function calling. All the functions are pre-defined in the agent.
4. Performance-aware iterative optimization: Considers the required key AMS metrics during sizing. Result history is also used to provide a highly relevant context to enable effective in-context learning.

### Basic Usage 
1. Choose a LLM model from [Claude 3 family](/agent_test_claude/agent_claude3.5.ipynb), [GPT 4o](/agent_test_gpt/agent_4o.ipynb) and [4o mini](/agent_test_gpt/agent_4omini.ipynb), and [gemini 2.0](/agent_test_gemini/gemini_2.0.ipynb) are available in the corresponding folder. 
Please add your api key and url in .env use the format below:
```
API_URL="your url"
API_KEY=your api
```
2. Find a netlist in [available netlist](/initial_circuit_netlist) or prepare your own circuit netlist (SPICE format) and load it to netlist input:
```
with open('../initial_circuit_netlist/complementary_classAB_opamp.cir', 'r') as f:
    netlist = f.read() 
```
or copy and paste it to variable 'netlist'.

3. Specify your performance constraints from available metrics and input to 'User input' block and input to variable:
```
tasks_generation_question = "This is a circuit netlist, optimize this circuit with ... "
```
4. Run the LLM-sizing tool and get the results.
5. Further verify the circuit by a variation test in [variation](/variation)
